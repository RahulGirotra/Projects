# Real-time Face Mask Detector with Keras and Deep Learning

# keypoints:-
1) End-to-End Face Mask Detector using python and training model using VGG16 and MobileNetV2 with Transfer learning
2) Comparing out best accuracy between VGG16 and MobileNetV2 giving around 96% accuracy after introducing Transfer learning
3) Improvising project with introducing Face detector below our model to get performance improvement
